This folder contains the code for the matting module. 

**Deatils** - 

The matting network takes as input an RGB image (𝐶). A multi-task encoder-decoder architecture (U-Net [Ronneberger et al. 2015]) is then used to predict the alpha channel 𝛼 and the foreground 𝐹.

**Dataset** - Dataset used for training and testing purpose can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1LqUU7BZeiq8I3i5KxApdOJ2haXm-cEv1)
